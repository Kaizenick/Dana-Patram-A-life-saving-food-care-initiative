The main objective of the project is to 
in our country goes to bed with an empty stomach while 
food that is being thrown away or drained away. We are trying to 
become a link between the two significant issues of the country. The 
portal will make sure that the leftover food or extra food is being

### APPLICATION
The application of the project will be for the NGOs that donate or 
distribute the food to the needy people. This portal will act as a mediator 
for them to go and collect the food from the people who are willing to 
donate it. 

## TECHNICAL WORK

*First we have decided to make a website first then if time permits we are 
planning to create an app because app is end to end, and we want the whole 
community to make use of our portal through our website

*For the website, we summoned a meeting and took a look at various 
options at our disposal and we finally decided that we will be using Google 
Web Services to host our Backend Services. Our website will be very user
friendly and will be accessible to all groups of people. The following is the 
interface of the website

### LIST OF NGOs AND RESTAURANTS CONTACTED 
* Since it’s an initiative to make people understand the amount of 
wastage that is done and how it could be useful for the people who are 
actually in need and the amount of food wasted can feed someone who 
had no choice but to go to bed with an empty stomach. So first we had 
contacted a list of NGOs who does the work of supplying food to the 
people in need. We conveyed our idea to them and asked them the real 
world issues that they face so as to have a basic understanding of our 
project in the real world. 
* We also had to talk to the several restaurants and hotel chains in 
our neighboring area and shared our idea to them. We can understand 
that usually not all the restaurant owners are left with much food at the 
end of the day but they agreed if there is any portal like that then they 
will be willing to give the food to the people who will actually need it.

## REVIEWS OF PEOPLE CONTACTED 
* We have contacted a restaurant Uncle Bobs who agrees to donate 
leftover food whenever possible and was very impressed by the idea. 
* We also contacted a very popular restaurant Foodies Bar, he liked the 
idea but he said that there is very little chance when there is leftover 
food 
* All India roti Bank trust – we talked to Mr.Kishore Tiwari. He liked 
the idea about our project and told the problem that as faced by him 
was that sometimes he receives calls from people who have food for 
only 2 or 3 people and if he does not go to take that food it portrays 
wrong on his part. But only for 2 3 people the transportation raises a 
problem for him. 
* Feeding India – we talked to Miss Shrishti, she is impressed with the 
idea and told she will be giving her feedback soon. 18

collaboration with the restaurants and is very much looking forward 
for our project

giving his feedback soon in the google form

will save him transportation cost and that he will know when there 
will be any surplus food left with anyone so that he does not have to 
go to people and ask for surplus food. 
* Mera Parivar – He told his main issue is that they need more help with 
volunteers and that he will soon give his feedback 
* No food wastage – This organization has their helpline number where 
people call up and connect to them when they have surplus food. They 
liked the idea of the NGO keeping a track of the food rather than 
people calling them up. 

## FIRST DONATION OF DANA PATRAM 
 One of our team members, Naman contacted many NGOs and 
restaurants in his locality that is in the city of Mathura before lockdown, 
and talked to them face to face and many of them liked the idea of 
DANA PATRAM and hence they were willing to contribute in this. 
 As all the restaurants are closed due to lockdown, it was getting 
hard to do the field work. One restaurant named 7 minutes called me, and 
told me that they are having a pooja in their house and would like to 
donate, they entered the food items on our site DANA PATRAM. Then I 
contacted a NGO named smile revolution in Mathura and they collected 
the food and distributed to the poor people. 

## SECOND DONATION OF DANA PATRAM 
The second donation because of DANA PATRAM which was done by 
another team member Aanchal. In a small town of Rawatbhata a local 
foundation named Aashirwad foundation. The foundation has donated 
food to almost 60 poor people with the help of DANA PATRAM and 
with food they have given clothes and some basic grocery as well. 
The website link was forwarded to all the people who would be willing 
to donate for the cause.Then on the day of distribution of the food, the 19 
owner of the founder just visited our website and took food from each 
and every person who mentioned their details in that locality. After 
collecting it they went to a nearby village and distributed the food to the 
people there. That feeling of complacency that we get is immense. We 
are so glad that our project could help in reaching out so many people 
and also making it easy for the people who does this noble work of 
sharing happiness among people. 
We tried to catch the glimpses of that moment when we reached there 
and shared the bliss to the people. 20 

## CONCLUSION
To conclude the project we have implemented our project in the Real 
World and found the answers to the problems. The project is successfully 
implemented with the help of two foundations and a hotel and group of 
people who wanted to donate.
